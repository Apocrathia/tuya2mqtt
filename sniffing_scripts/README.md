I am using these scripts with a WB8 pulled out of a Fairy Light Controller plopped into an ESP8266 code burner and plugged into my computer. The script uses the product ID (pulled from Tasmota) to tell the WB8 which device it is. The WB8 then communicates this to the Tuya Servers and App then my phone gets the user interface associated with that device. This then allows me to click around in the app and get the Status Data Units (SDUs) that the App is trying to send through the WB8 to the Tuya MCU.
