- TuyaMCU Capability
Module 54

- ESP12F On-Board LED (if you tranplanted an ESP12F into your device)
GPIO02 -> LEDLinki

- TuyaMCU tries to assign dpid=1 to a switch. We won't be using any Tasmota built in Tuya control, so turn that off with this command:
TuyaMCU 99,1

- Get MQTT Publishes
SetOption66 1

- Set timezone right bc this thing uses alarms (US, Eastern Time)
Backlog TimeStd 0,1,11,1,2,-300; TimeDst 0,2,3,1,2,-240; timezone 99

- Make sure Tasmota MQTT topics are set like tele/tasmota_ABCDEF/... instead of tasmota_ABCDEF/tele/...
